# FORTE Icon - AI Image Generation Prompt

## For Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Adobe Firefly

---

### Concept Summary

FORTE is a Fortran language IDE. "Forte" means strength, and Fortran (FORmula TRANslation) is one of the oldest and most powerful scientific computing languages. The icon shows a **front-on view of a fortress gate** — two flanking towers with battlements, connected by a central gatehouse with a grand arched gateway. The entire fortress is built from Fortran syntax characters: `=` (assignment), `**` (exponentiation), `()` (array indexing), `!` (comments) arranged as courses of stonework. A glowing **F** appears in the arch gateway, backlit like torchlight through a portcullis. Color palette is steel blue and silver — cold military precision.

### Primary Prompt

A square app icon on a very dark near-black background with a cold blue atmosphere. The icon depicts a **front-on view of a fortress gate** — two tall stone towers flanking a central gatehouse, all with distinctive battlements (crenellations) along the top edge. The entire fortress stonework is constructed from Fortran programming syntax characters: `=` `**` `()` `!` arranged in alternating horizontal rows like courses of stone, glowing in steel blue and silver tones (#4a6888, #6a90b8). The towers have narrow arrow-slit windows. The central gatehouse has a grand **pointed arch gateway** with a portcullis rendered as vertical `!` characters and horizontal bars. Inside the arch, a large glowing capital letter **F** shines in bright white with a soft blue radiant halo, as if lit by torchlight from within the fortress. A decorative keystone sits at the apex of the arch. Color palette is entirely steel blue and silver — cold, military, precise — on a near-black background. Cinematic, high contrast, professional app icon, 1:1 square format, no text other than the letter F and Fortran syntax characters.

### DALL-E 3 Specific Version

```
Create a professional square app icon on a very dark near-black background with a cold steel blue atmosphere. Design a front-on view of a stone fortress gate: two tall flanking towers and a central gatehouse, all topped with battlements (alternating merlons and crenels). The entire surface of the fortress is textured with rows of Fortran programming characters — "=", "**", "()", "!" — arranged in alternating horizontal courses like stonework, glowing in steel blue and silver tones. Each tower has narrow vertical arrow-slit windows. The central gatehouse features a pointed arch gateway with a portcullis rendered as vertical "!" characters crossed with horizontal bars. Inside the arch, a large glowing capital letter "F" in bright white with a soft blue halo appears to be backlit by torchlight from within. A keystone marks the arch apex. Color palette is strictly steel blue and silver — cold, military, precise. Cinematic, high contrast, professional icon style.

### Adobe Firefly / Generic Version

```
App icon: front-on stone fortress gate, two flanking towers with battlements and arrow-slit windows, central gatehouse with pointed arch gateway, entire stonework built from Fortran syntax characters = ** () ! in glowing steel blue and silver rows. Portcullis of ! characters in arch. Glowing white capital F inside arch with blue torchlight halo. Steel blue silver military palette on dark background. Cinematic, professional, 1:1 square.

### Tips for Best Results

- Upload the BLAZE icon as style reference for glow quality and dark background
- If the fortress looks too flat: *"the fortress should have a sense of depth and mass, the towers should feel solid and imposing"*
- If syntax characters aren't visible: *"the = ** () ! characters should be individually readable as text, arranged in horizontal rows across the stone surface"*
- If the arch F is too small: *"the letter F in the arch should be large enough to read at thumbnail icon size, the brightest element in the image"*
- Key detail to emphasize: *"the portcullis inside the arch should be made of vertical ! exclamation mark characters — this is a deliberate Fortran comment-character reference"*
